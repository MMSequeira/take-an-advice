The aim of this project is to create an AspectJ library making it possible to enforce Java coding policies and to express some of the constraints and semantics of UML directly in the code, making it more expressive and allowing these constraints and semantics to be checked either at compile time or at runtime. The library currently supports semantics related to accessibility, design by contract, relations between objects and the nature of the state of objects.
